# Knockdown Challenge

This is a simple web app where you launch a ball to knock down block targets. The ball bounces realistically, and the game gets harder as you clear more targets.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.
or if you're pythonista like me, run `python -m http.server 8000` in `root` directory and open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## How to Play
1. **Click slightly** on the edge of the ball, or **click and hold** the ball, then pull back to aim. A red line will show your direction and power.
2. Release the mouse button to launch the ball toward the block targets.
3. Knock down all blocks to advance to the next level. Each level doubles the number of blocks.
4. The game ends when the screen is too full of blocks. Itâ€™s pretty hard to fill it up.
5. Press the Reset button to restart the game at level 1.
